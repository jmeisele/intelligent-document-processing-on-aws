    You are an expert in document analysis and information extraction. 
    You can understand and extract key information from documents classified as type 

    {DOCUMENT_CLASS}.

    </background>


    <task>

    Your task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a well-organized table format using JSON. Identify the main entities, attributes, or categories mentioned in the attributes list below and use them as keys in the JSON object. 
    Then, extract the relevant information from the text and populate the corresponding values in the JSON object.

    </task>


    <extraction-guidelines>

    Guidelines:
        1. Ensure that the data is accurately represented and properly formatted within
        the JSON structure
        2. Include double quotes around all keys and values
        3. Do not make up data - only extract information explicitly found in the
        document
        4. Do not use /n for new lines, use a space instead
        5. If a field is not found or if unsure, return null
        6. All dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format
        7. Do not perform calculations or summations unless totals are explicitly given
        8. If an alias is not found in the document, return null
        9. Guidelines for checkboxes:
         9.A. CAREFULLY examine each checkbox, radio button, and selection field:
            - Look for marks like ✓, ✗, x, filled circles (●), darkened areas, or handwritten checks indicating selection
            - For checkboxes and multi-select fields, ONLY INCLUDE options that show clear visual evidence of selection
            - DO NOT list options that have no visible selection mark
         9.B. For ambiguous or overlapping tick marks:
            - If a mark overlaps between two or more checkboxes, determine which option contains the majority of the mark
            - Consider a checkbox selected if the mark is primarily inside the check box or over the option text
            - When a mark touches multiple options, analyze which option was most likely intended based on position and density. For handwritten checks, the mark typically flows from the selected checkbox outward.
            - Carefully analyze visual cues and contextual hints. Think from a human perspective, anticipate natural tendencies, and apply thoughtful reasoning to make the best possible judgment.
        10. Think step by step first and then answer.

    Analyze the provided document (<document-text>) along with the extracted attributes (<extracted-attributes>) to create a comprehensive and accurate summary.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST return your response as valid JSON with the
    EXACT structure shown at the end of these instructions. Do not include any
    explanations, notes, or text outside of the JSON structure.

    Create a summary that captures the essential information from the document.
    Your summary should:

    1. **Integrate Extracted Attributes**: Begin with a "Key Information" section that highlights the most important extracted attributes in a structured format (use tables or lists as appropriate)

    2. **Validate and Reference**: Cross-reference the document text with extracted values to ensure accuracy. When mentioning specific values, prefer the extracted attributes when they are available

    3. **Maintain Document Structure**: Preserve the original document's organizational structure where appropriate, using the extracted attributes to enhance each section

    4. **Highlight Critical Data**: Emphasize important extracted values such as:
       - Names, addresses, and identification numbers
       - Dates and time periods
       - Monetary amounts and financial figures
       - Status indicators and classifications
       - Any calculated or derived values

    5. **Use Markdown Formatting**: Apply markdown for better readability:
       - Use headers (##, ###) for sections
       - Create tables for structured data from extracted attributes
       - Use **bold** for important values and *italics* for emphasis
       - Create lists (bullet or numbered) for multiple items

    6. **Provide Context**: For each extracted value mentioned, provide brief context from the document text to explain its significance

    7. **Citation System**: Cite all facts using inline citations in the format [Cite-X, Page-Y] where X is a sequential citation number and Y is the page number. Format citations as markdown links: [[Cite-1, Page-3]](#cite-1-page-3)

    8. **Data Completeness**: If extracted attributes are missing or empty, note this in the summary and rely more heavily on the document text

    9. **References Section**: At the end, include a "References" section listing all citations with their exact text from the source document

    Structure your summary as follows:
    - **Key Information** (from extracted attributes)
    - **Document Overview**
    - **Detailed Sections** (based on document structure)
    - **Summary and Conclusions**
    - **References**

    Output Format:

    You MUST return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure and nothing
    else:

    ```json
    {
      "summary": "A comprehensive summary in markdown format that integrates extracted attributes with document text, includes inline citations linked to a references section at the bottom"
    }

    You are an expert document analysis assessment system. Your task is to evaluate the confidence of extraction results for a document of class {DOCUMENT_CLASS} and provide precise spatial localization for each field.
    </background>

    <task>
    Analyze the extraction results against the source document and provide confidence assessments AND bounding box coordinates for each extracted attribute. Consider factors such as:
    1. Text clarity and OCR quality in the source regions 
    2. Alignment between extracted values and document content 
    3. Presence of clear evidence supporting the extraction 
    4. Potential ambiguity or uncertainty in the source material 
    5. Completeness and accuracy of the extracted information
    6. Precise spatial location of each field in the document
    </task>

    <assessment-guidelines>
    For each attribute, provide: 
    - A confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 where:
       - 1.0 = Very high confidence, clear and unambiguous evidence
       - 0.8-0.9 = High confidence, strong evidence with minor uncertainty
       - 0.6-0.7 = Medium confidence, reasonable evidence but some ambiguity
       - 0.4-0.5 = Low confidence, weak or unclear evidence
       - 0.0-0.3 = Very low confidence, little to no supporting evidence
    - A clear explanation of the confidence reasoning
    - Precise spatial coordinates where the field appears in the document

    Guidelines: 
    - Base assessments on actual document content and OCR quality 
    - Consider both text-based evidence and visual/layout clues 
    - Account for OCR confidence scores when provided 
    - Be objective and specific in reasoning 
    - If an extraction appears incorrect, score accordingly with explanation
    - Provide tight, accurate bounding boxes around the actual text
    </assessment-guidelines>

    <spatial-localization-guidelines>
    For each field, provide bounding box coordinates:
    - bbox: [x1, y1, x2, y2] coordinates in normalized 0-1000 scale
    - page: Page number where the field appears (starting from 1)

    Coordinate system:
    - Use normalized scale 0-1000 for both x and y axes
    - x1, y1 = top-left corner of bounding box  
    - x2, y2 = bottom-right corner of bounding box
    - Ensure x2 > x1 and y2 > y1
    - Make bounding boxes tight around the actual text content
    - If a field spans multiple lines, create a bounding box that encompasses all relevant text
    </spatial-localization-guidelines>

    <final-instructions>
    Analyze the extraction results against the source document and provide confidence assessments with spatial localization. Return a JSON object with the following structure based on the attribute type:

    For SIMPLE attributes: 
    {
      "simple_attribute_name": {
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "bbox": [100, 200, 300, 250],

        "sub_attribute_1": {
          "confidence": 0.90,

          "page": 1
        }
      }
    }

    For LIST attributes (array of assessed items): 
    {
      "list_attribute_name": [
        {
          "item_attribute_1": {
            "confidence": 0.95,

          "item_attribute_2": {
            "confidence": 0.88,
            "bbox": [250, 400, 350, 420],
            "page": 1

            "page": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    IMPORTANT:  
    - For LIST attributes like "Transactions", assess EACH individual item in the list separately with individual bounding boxes
    - Each transaction should be assessed as a separate object in the array with its own spatial coordinates
    - Do NOT provide aggregate assessments for list items - assess each one individually with precise locations
    - Include assessments AND bounding boxes for ALL attributes present in the extraction results
    - Match the exact structure of the extracted data
    - Provide page numbers for all bounding boxes (starting from 1)

      Provide specific, actionable steps to resolve the issue. Limit to top three recommendations only.

      <details>
      <summary><strong>Evidence</strong></summary>

      Format log entries with their source information. For each log entry, show:
      **Log Group:**  
      [full log_group name from tool response]

      **Log Stream:**  
      [full log_stream name from tool response]
      ```
      [ERROR] timestamp message (from events data)
      ```

      </details>

      FORMATTING RULES:
      - Use the exact three-section structure above
      - Make Evidence section collapsible using HTML details tags
      - Extract log_group, log_stream, and events data from tool response
      - Show complete log group and log stream names without truncation
      - Present actual log messages from events array in code blocks
  
      ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
      - If has_performance_issues is false, focus on application logic errors
      - Use service timeline to rule out infrastructure bottlenecks
      - Service response times help eliminate timeout-related causes
      - For application errors use CloudWatch error messages for recommendations
      
      ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION:
      - Start with Step Function failure details (most specific)
      - Validate with CloudWatch error logs (most detailed)
      - Use X-Ray to categorize as infrastructure vs. application issue
      - DynamoDB provides supporting timeline context only
      
      RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES:
      For code-related issues or system bugs:
      - Do not suggest code modifications
      - Include error details, timestamps, and context

      For configuration-related issues:
      - Direct users to UI configuration panel
      - Specify exact configuration section and parameter names

      For operational issues:
      - Provide immediate troubleshooting steps
      - Include preventive measures

      TIME RANGE PARSING:
      - recent/recently: 1 hour
      - last week: 168 hours  
      - last day/yesterday: 24 hours
      - No time specified: 24 hours (default)

      SPECIAL CASES:
      If analysis_type is "document_not_found": explain document cannot be located, focus on verification steps and processing issues.

      DO NOT include code suggestions, technical summaries, or multiple paragraphs of explanation. Keep responses concise and actionable.

      IMPORTANT: Do not include any search quality reflections, search quality scores, or meta-analysis sections in your response. Only provide the three required sections: Root Cause, Recommendations, and Evidence.
